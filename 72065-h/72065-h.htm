<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> some of my young
readers have been at Riverdale;
if they have not, I must
tell them that it is a very
pretty place. The village is
on the banks of a river, that
comes from many miles away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
among the hills and mountains;
and that is the reason
why it is called <i>Riverdale</i>.
But I will not stop now to
tell my little friends about the
place, for they will find out
all they wish to know about
it before they have done reading
the story.</p>

<p>There were rich people and
poor people in Riverdale, as
there are in almost every
other place, and my story<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
begins in the humble cottage
of a poor widow. It was not
a pretty white cottage, with
green blinds, and a nice flower
garden in front of it, but
it was a dingy old house
that had never been painted.
Nothing had been done to
make it look pretty, and it
seemed hardly fit to live in.</p>

<p>The poor widow’s name was
Jane White. Her husband,
who had been a laborer, died<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
only a year before, and left
her with a family of four children.
She had to work very
hard to get money enough to
buy food and clothes for her
little boys and girls, and you
may be sure they did not have
any nice things to eat, nor
any fine clothes to wear.</p>

<p>Her oldest boy’s name was
David White. He was not
quite nine years old. But he
was big enough to help his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
mother a great deal, as any
little boy of that age may do,
if he only tries.</p>

<p>David used to take care of
the baby, bring in the wood
and water, see to the fire,
and do a great many other
things that were not beyond
his strength. His mother sent
him to school, for she wanted
her boy to be a wise and good
man when he grew up. It
was very kind of her to let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
David go to school, when she
wanted him so much to help
her take care of the children,
and to do the chores.</p>

<p>Mrs. White used to earn
money by “closing” shoes;—that
is, by sewing up the
seams. David could not help
seeing that she had to work
very hard, and he often wished
that he could close shoes, and
thus get a little money. He
tried two or three times to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
sew up some strips of leather,
but he did not make out very
well; and his mother told him
he was not big enough to do
such work.</p>

<p>A great many times did
David wish he was a great
man, so that he could take
care of his mother, and his
little brother and sisters. He
thought if he was, he would
earn lots of money. Then he
would not let his mother sit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
up so late nights to close
shoes.</p>

<p>It was of no use to wish he
was a man, for he was only a
little boy. The next best thing
he could do was to help her
all he could; and Mrs. White
had no reason to find fault
with him, for he did all he
was able, and was willing to
do a great deal more. Still
he could not help thinking
what a fine thing it would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
to earn money for his mother.
The more he thought about it,
the more he wanted to do
something.</p>

<p>Those who are willing to
help themselves are almost
always sure to find some one
who is willing to help them.
If we try to do well, there are
plenty of friends who will do
all they can for us.</p>

<p>David’s mother used to let
him go to the river to catch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
fish, but she always told him,
when he was going, to be very
careful not to fall into the
water. He used to mind what
she said, for he knew how
sad she would feel if he
should be drowned, as John
Piper had been only the year
before. He felt that it was
his duty to take care of his
mother when he got big
enough. If he should be
lost, what would become of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
her, when she was too old to
work?</p>

<p>He had a fish-pole and line
that had been his father’s, and
with these he used to catch
pouts, perch, and shiners; and
once he had caught a great
pickerel. These fish were all
good to eat, and when David
had caught a mess of them,
he felt that he had done something
to feed the family.</p>

<p>One day he wanted to go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
a fishing, and like a good boy,
he asked his mother. The
baby was asleep, and Arthur
and Susan were building a
house in the sand before the
cottage; and so she told him
he might.</p>

<p>David took down his fish-pole,
got a little basket from
the wood-shed, and started for
the river. He felt just as
though he wanted to do some
great thing. He wanted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
catch something better than
perch and shiners. So he
took a big stick, and when
he came to the river, he
walked till he heard a “chug”—which
is the noise that a
bull-frog makes.</p>

<p>Then he stopped, and pretty
soon he saw the green
head of a frog sticking out
of the water. Froggy looked
at him slyly, as though he
knew what he meant to do.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
As David crept up to him,
Froggy gave another “chug,”
and darted into the water,
hiding himself under a lily-pad
that grew near the shore.</p>

<p>David could not find him;
so he walked along till he
saw another. He was more
careful, and I don’t think
Froggy heard him this time.</p>

<p>“You just sit still half a
second more,” said he to himself,
“and I’ll have you. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
need not wink at me; I want
one of your hind legs for
bait.”</p>

<p>As soon as he got near
enough, he raised the big
stick, and brought it down
upon the head of poor Froggy.
It was a hard blow, and
the frog was killed by it.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of my kind-hearted
little readers will say
it was too bad for David to
kill the frog. It would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
been very wicked, if he had
not wanted the frog for bait.
He had done the act in order
to get food for his mother
and his brother and sisters.</p>

<p>Taking out his knife, he
cut off one of the hind legs
of the frog, and put it on the
hook. There were a great
many pickerel in the river.
They are a very fine fish,
and often grow to be quite
large. A frog’s leg is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
best bait to catch them with,
and David wished ever so
much that he could catch a
big pickerel.</p>

<p>He dragged the frog’s leg
over the water for half an
hour, hoping a pickerel would
jump up and catch hold of it.
At last he heard a splash,
and felt a fish pulling very
hard at the line.</p>

<p>He hoped he should catch
him, and even before he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
seen the fish, he began to
think what he should do with
him. But he had a little plan
in his head, and if he could
only get the fish, he was
almost sure of doing a great
thing.</p>

</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Hold</span> on tight, Fishy,” said
David, as he tugged away at
the fish-pole.</p>

<p>I don’t think the fish would
have minded what he said, if
he could have helped himself.
But the pickerel was well
hooked, and could not get
away. The pole bent as David
pulled, and he was afraid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
it would break. He was very
careful, and after a deal of
tugging he pulled the fish
out of the water, and landed
him on the grass.</p>

<p>It was a nice large pickerel,
and David felt like a
great man then, for he had
caught a big fish. He put
him in the basket, and put
some grass over him. Then
he tried again, but could get
no more pickerel; so he put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
a worm on the hook for bait,
and pretty soon he caught
perch and shiners enough for
dinner the next day.</p>

<p>While he sat on the rock,
David kept thinking of something.
He wanted to earn
some money for his mother;
and this was what he was
thinking about. He had now
formed a plan by which he
hoped to do it. After winding
up his line, he took the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
basket of fish on his arm, and
started for home.</p>

<p>Just before he came to the
house, he took the pickerel
out of the basket, and hid
it in the grass, for he did
not want his mother to see
this fish. Then he carried
the basket into the house,
and asked his mother if he
might stay out a little while
longer. She said he might;
and he ran back to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
place where he had put the
pickerel.</p>

<p>Putting the fish into another
basket he had brought,
he laid some fresh grass upon
it, and walked up to the village.
He stopped before a
large, fine house, with a grove
and a nice garden before it.
He did not feel so brave then
as before, and he paused for
some time before he dared
to enter the garden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>At last he pushed the gate
open, and went in. As he
was walking up to the house,
a great dog ran out at him,
and barked as though he
meant to tear him in pieces.
David was afraid of the big
dog, but he did not like to
go away without seeing Mr.
Lee, who lived in the fine
house.</p>

<p>“Be still, Watch,” said the
sweet voice of a little girl;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
“what do you make all that
noise for?”</p>

<p>In a moment, David saw
the little girl running towards
him. She was not more than
eight years old, and had
such pretty curls that David
thought she must be an
angel. She went up to the
big dog, and with her little
hand struck him on the
head, and told him again to
be still.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>“You are naughty, Watch,
to bark at a little boy, and
if you don’t hold your tongue,
you shall have no supper.
Go, lie down!”</p>

<p>Watch wagged his great
bushy tail, and kissed the
little girl’s hand, just as
though he loved her very
much. The blow she had
given him did not hurt him,
and Watch did not seem to
be afraid of her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>“What do you want, little
boy?” asked Flora Lee; for
that was her name.</p>

<p>“I have got a great big
pickerel that I caught in the
river; and I want to sell him
to your father,” replied David.</p>

<p>“Do let me see him!”
said Flora.</p>

<p>David pulled out the grass,
and the little girl looked at
the fish, said he was a monster,
and did not see how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
David could have caught
him.</p>

<p>“He pulled very hard,”
added David, “but I got him
out. He is a very nice fish,
and I heard a man say that
your father was very fond of
pickerel.”</p>

<p>“He is.”</p>

<p>“My mother is poor, and
has to work very hard; I
want to get some money to
help her, if I can.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>“You are a nice boy to
help your mother, and my
father shall buy the fish; if
he won’t, I will,” said Flora.</p>

<p>“Thank you, little miss.”</p>

<p>“Now come with me, and
I will take you to my pa,”
added Flora.</p>

<p>David followed the little
girl into the great house.
Our hero had never seen
any thing so fine before.
Flora led him into the house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
by the front door, which was
not the way to take a fish
boy in; but she was so eager
to have David sell his fish,
she did not think of that.</p>

<p>“O pa, here! Come quick!”
said Flora, as she threw open
the door of the room where
her father was reading the
paper.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Flora?”
asked he.</p>

<p>“Nothing, pa; only here is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
a nice little boy that has got
a great big pickerel; he wants
to sell it to you, pa, and you
must buy it,” said Flora, talking
as fast as she could.</p>

<p>“Must I?” asked Mr. Lee,
with a smile. “Perhaps I
shall not.”</p>

<p>“But you must! This little
boy wants to earn some
money to help his mother.
She is poor, and has to work
very hard.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>“That may be. What does
he ask for the pickerel?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know;” and then
Flora ran back to David.</p>

<p>“What is your name, little
boy?”</p>

<p>“David White.”</p>

<p>Mr. Lee then came out into
the entry where David was.</p>

<p>“Well, my little man, you
have a fish to sell—have
you?” said Mr. Lee.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; a man told me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
you liked pickerel—and I
came up to see if you wanted
this one,” said David, taking
off his hat.</p>

<p>Mr. Lee looked at the fish,
and said it was a very fine
one. He then asked the
price, and David told him
he might give him what he
pleased for it.</p>

<p>“Give him a good deal for
it, pa,” said Flora.</p>

<p>“I will give him half a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
dollar; that is more than the
fish is worth, but he is a
good boy;” and he handed
him the money.</p>

<p>Flora showed him into the
kitchen, and David gave the
pickerel to the cook.</p>

<p>“You must catch some
more and bring them here,
and my father shall buy
them,” said Flora, who went
with him to the gate.</p>

<p>“I will if I can,” replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
David; and he ran towards
home with all his might.</p>

<p>How happy he was! How
tightly he held on to the
bright half dollar in his
hand! Wouldn’t his mother
open her eyes when he gave
it to her! How glad it
would make her! He had
never held so much money in
his hand before; and he had
earned it. He felt more like
a great man than he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
ever felt before. He had done
a big thing—even bigger
than he had hoped when the
fish first bit the hook.</p>

<p>Half a dollar! David wondered
if any other little boy
ever earned so much money
in one day.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">See</span> what I have got,
mother!” said David, as he
ran into the house.</p>

<p>“Hush, David; you will
wake up the baby,” replied
his mother. “What have you
got?”</p>

<p>“Half a dollar,” answered
David, as he put the money
into his mother’s hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>“Why, where did you get
it?”</p>

<p>“I earned it, mother,” said
David, in a whisper, lest he
should wake little Mary. “I
caught a big pickerel in the
river, and I sold it to Mr.
Lee, and he gave me half a
dollar for it.”</p>

<p>“You have done well, David;
half a dollar is a great
deal of money to poor folks,
like us,” replied his mother,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
as she took the coin. “I will
use this to buy you some
clothes.”</p>

<p>“Don’t use it for me, mother,
but for yourself. I never
felt so happy before in my
life. I wish I could earn
some more money.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, there will be a
chance by and by.”</p>

<p>When David went to bed
that night, instead of going
to sleep, he lay awake to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
think of some way in which
he might help his mother.
If he could only earn half a
dollar every day, it would
almost support the family.
But he could not think of
any way, and so he went to
sleep, and dreamed about it.</p>

<p>When he got up the next
morning, the first thing he
thought of was the half dollar
he had earned the day
before. School did not keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
that day, and he went down
to the river to catch some
more pickerel. He got three,
but they were not so large
as the one he had caught the
day before. He carried them
into the village, and after trying
at a dozen houses, he
could find no one to buy
them. He felt very bad when
he carried them home, but
his mother told him he must
not lose his courage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>Mrs. White cooked the pickerel
for their dinner that day,
and David said they were
very good, and he did not
see why no one would buy
them. After dinner David’s
mother sent him to the store
to get some sugar. While
the grocer was putting it
up, he heard a man in the
store say they ought to have
the Boston papers in Riverdale,
and he did not see why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
they could not be left at the
people’s houses, as they were
in other places.</p>

<p>As he walked home, David
thought he might carry the
papers round and sell them.
He had heard about the boys
who sold them in Boston.
His mother had seen little
fellows, no bigger than he
was, selling them in the city.
If he could only get them
he would try the plan. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
eyes grew very bright as he
thought of it.</p>

<p>“I will do it,” said he to
himself. “At least, I will try
to do it. I will go right off
and see Mr. Field, the express
man, and get him to
bring me out some papers
next Monday.”</p>

<p>When he had carried the
sugar home, he started for
Mr. Field’s house. He found
him at work in his garden,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
and told him what he wanted.</p>

<p>“Do you think you can sell
the papers, my boy?” asked
the express man.</p>

<p>“I can try, sir; my mother
is very poor, and has to work
very hard. I want to do
something to help her if I
can.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good boy,”
said the man, very kindly;
“and if I can do any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
thing for you I am sure I
will.”</p>

<p>“If you will bring me the
papers from Boston, I think
I can sell them.”</p>

<p>“You shall have a chance
to try, my boy. I will bring
you some next Monday. How
many do you want?”</p>

<p>“Not many at first, sir.”</p>

<p>“Say twenty or thirty?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I will bring them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>David was so glad he hardly
knew what to do with himself.
He ran home and told
his mother what he had done,
and she was as glad as he
was when she thought what
a smart son she had, and how
anxious he was to help her.</p>

<p>Monday came; David was
at the railroad station when
the train came, and Mr. Field
gave him the papers. David
took them under his arm.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
How his heart beat with fear
lest he should not be able to
sell them! But he meant to
work very hard, and he felt
almost sure that he should
sell them.</p>

<p>There were two dozen papers.
They cost fifteen cents
a dozen, or thirty cents for
the whole. At two cents
each, they would come to
forty-eight cents. This would
leave David a profit of eighteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
cents, and this would
do very well for a start.</p>

<p>“What have you got there,
boy?” said a gentleman.</p>

<p>“The Journal, sir. Two
cents each,” replied David,
taking one of the papers from
under his arm.</p>

<p>“Give me one;” and the
man handed him two cents.</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p>“I want one every day.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir; I shall be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
glad to sell you one every
day.”</p>

<p>“You may leave it at my
house.”</p>

<p>He pointed out his house
to David, and he told him he
would leave one there every
day.</p>

<p>The little merchant was
cheered by this sale. It was
a good start, and he felt sure
that almost every man in the
place would want a paper.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
Pretty soon he came to the
grocery store, and he went
in to follow up his good
luck. There were six or
seven men in the shop besides
the keeper.</p>

<p>“Buy the Journal, sir?
Only two cents. Got all the
news in it,” said David, showing
the paper to the storekeeper.</p>

<p>“Is that you, David?”
asked the man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>“Yes, sir; don’t you want
a paper?”</p>

<p>“I do; I am very glad to
get one;” and the man handed
him two cents, and took
a Journal.</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” said David,
for his mother had told
him he must be polite to all
with whom he had dealings.</p>

<p>“You have gone into business—have
you, David?”
added the man, with a smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>“Yes, sir; I am trying to
do something to help my
mother.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good boy. You
will find plenty of people to
buy your papers, for they all
want them.”</p>

<p>David sold five papers in
the store, and with a light
heart he ran over to the great
shoe shop on the other side
of the road. A great many
men were at work there, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
when the little merchant told
them he was selling papers
to help his mother, nearly
every one of them bought a
paper, and he had only six
left when he went out of the
shop.</p>

<p>Five of these were sold in
a short time, and he had
only one left. He felt sure
that Flora Lee’s father would
want one, and he saved this
one for him. He found Flora<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
in the garden playing with
the great dog, and he told
her what he had been doing.
She felt a deep interest in
the little hero, and when he
had told his story, she led
him to her father. Mr. Lee
took his last paper, and
wished him to bring him
one every day.</p>

<p>How happy David was
then! He had “sold out,”
and had made eighteen cents.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
But he was an honest boy,
and he went at once to Mr.
Field’s to pay for his papers,
and to speak for some more
the next day. The express
man said he had done well,
after he had told his story,
and thought he could sell as
many as four dozen papers
the next day.</p>

<p>David ran home, and told
his mother all about it. She
was as glad as he was at his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
success. She was pleased,
not only because he had made
some money, but because he
had tried so hard to do something
for her.</p>

<p>Eighteen cents is a very
small sum, it is true, but the
poor widow could think of a
great many little comforts
which it would buy. But if
her son could earn this sum
every day, it would be a real
blessing to her; for it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
supply the whole family with
good clothing. Do you wonder
that Mrs. White was
proud of her son?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day David sold
twice as many papers as he
had sold the day before. He
carried thirty-six cents home
to his mother that night.
This was as much money as
his mother had earned, and
he was as proud as a lord
of what he had done.</p>

<p>David now found himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
settled in the business; and
in a few weeks his mother
bought him a suit of clothes
with the money he had earned.
They had a great many nice
things at the cottage, which
they had not had since Mr.
White’s death.</p>

<p>But the little merchant did
not always have such good
luck as on the first days.
When he sold all his papers
one day, and had calls for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
more than he could supply,
he asked Mr. Field to bring
him six dozen. Then he could
not sell them, and this caused
a loss.</p>

<p>There were a few bad
boys in Riverdale, and David
had some trouble with them.
One day, when he was running
across a field with his
bundle of papers under his
arm, Joe Birch stopped him.
He was a bad boy, and did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
not like David, because the
little merchant was a good
boy, and would not idle away
his time with him.</p>

<p>“How many papers have
you sold, David?” asked Joe.</p>

<p>“About twenty,” replied
David.</p>

<p>“Give me one—will you?”</p>

<p>“I can’t give them away; I
have to pay for them.”</p>

<p>“What if you do?—can’t
you give me one?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>“If I have any left, I will
give you one,” said David.</p>

<p>Then he tried to get away
from the bad boy; but Joe
tripped him up, and he fell
at full length on the ground.
David did not care for the
fall, but all the money in his
pocket came out, and was
scattered about in the grass.</p>

<p>Joe was a good deal larger
than David, and our little
hero was afraid of him. So<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
he did not dare to say any
thing, though he felt very
bad indeed. He had a stout
heart, but he felt very much
like crying. This would do
no good; so he began to pick
up the cents.</p>

<p>The bad boy said he would
help him, and began to look
in the grass with David; but
he did not give him any of
the money he found. The
little merchant, after he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
looked a long while, found
only one half of what he had
lost. He felt very bad at the
idea of losing ten cents; but
he did not say any thing
about his loss, and ran on
to leave a paper at the
house on the other side of
the field.</p>

<p>“Hallo, David!” shouted
Joe.</p>

<p>“What do you want?”
asked David.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>“Do you mean to say I
have got any of the money?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say so.”</p>

<p>“’Cause if you do, I’ll whip
you.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say so.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you did.”</p>

<p>David did not answer him
again, but ran with all his
might to the house. When
he got to the door, he could
not control his feelings any
longer, and burst into tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>“What is the matter, David?”
asked John Gray, the
farmer’s son, as he gave him
a paper.</p>

<p>“I lost my money in the
field,” sobbed David.</p>

<p>“Joe Birch was with you—wasn’t
he?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and he tripped me
up, and when I fell, the
money all came out of my
pocket, and I lost ten cents.”</p>

<p>“You go back and ask<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
Joe Birch if he has any of
it. I know he has got some
of it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like to do that;
Joe will whip me if I do.”</p>

<p>“You go and ask him,
and I will be there in a
minute.”</p>

<p>David did not like to do
so, but John Gray said so
much that at last he agreed
to go. When he reached the
field again, Joe was leaving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
it; but he called after him, and
he stopped.</p>

<p>“Did you find any of my
money, Joe?” asked David,
who spoke in a very civil
manner.</p>

<p>“No, I did not. Do you
mean to say I got any of it?
If you do, I’ll whip you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t say so.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you do.”</p>

<p>Joe doubled up his fist,
and moved towards David.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
Our little merchant walked
away from him; but just
then John Gray came to the
spot.</p>

<p>“He says I’ve got some
of his money,” said Joe, as
John joined them.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you got some of
it?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Turn out your pockets,
and let me see,” said John.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to do that;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
but I haven’t got any of his
money,” replied Joe.</p>

<p>The bad boy then tried to
run away; but John caught
him, and turned his pockets
out for him. In one of them
he found eight of the cents
David had lost. John gave
them to David, and told Joe
if he touched him again, he
would put him in prison for
stealing.</p>

<p>David was very glad to get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
his money again; and while
John held Joe, he ran off to
sell the rest of his papers.
Joe was afraid of being put
in prison for what he had
done; so he did not dare to
whip David for telling John
about it.</p>

<p>This was only one of David’s
trials. He told his
mother about it when he got
home. She said he must not
mind it, and that he must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
have nothing to do with Joe,
for he was a very wicked
boy. She told him he must
not heed these troubles, for
every body in the world has
to meet them.</p>

<p>David kept on selling papers
for several years, and
the money he earned in this
way helped his mother very
much, and no mother could
be more happy in having
such a good son. I hope all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
my little friends will do all
they can to help their mothers.
If they cannot sell papers,
they can do a great
many things. They can at
least be good boys and girls,
and this will help their mothers
a good deal, and make
life very pleasant to them.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> years ago there lived
in Boston a carpenter whose
name was John Lowe. He
was very far from being a
rich man, and, though he received
fair wages for his labor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
he had a wife and four children
to support.</p>

<p>One Saturday evening, as he
was going down to the market,
a little boy of about ten
years of age stepped up to
him, and asked if he would
set him up in the newspaper
business.</p>

<p>The newsboys, in the large
cities of the United States,
make from four to six cents
a dozen on the papers they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
sell; but they have to be active,
and I am sure they earn their
money. It requires a little
capital to start with; and to
obtain this, the boy had accosted
John Lowe.</p>

<p>“How much do you want,
my boy?” asked he.</p>

<p>“Fifty cents, sir, if you
please,” replied the boy, whose
name was Henry Small. “But
I will pay it to you again,
just as soon as ever I can.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>The carpenter hesitated; but
the boy looked honest, and told
him a pitiful story of misfortune
and want at home; and
he finally gave him the money.</p>

<p>In two weeks, Henry Small
called at the carpenter’s house,
and paid the half dollar he had
borrowed. It was sixteen years
before he saw him again.</p>

<p>In that time John Lowe
had grown old and feeble.
He could not labor much, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
when hard times came he had
no work, and had nothing with
which to buy bread for himself
and his wife.</p>

<p>Two of his children had
died, and the other two were
sailors, and far away from
home. He had no one to help
him, and he feared that he
should be obliged to go to
the almshouse.</p>

<p>Every day he went out,
hoping to find a job by which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
he could earn enough to buy
food for himself and his wife;
but he was disappointed.</p>

<p>At last he made up his mind
to apply to the overseers of
the poor for assistance, for he
had not even a loaf of bread
in the house, or any money.</p>

<p>On his way to the City Hall,
he entered a store where some
carpenters were at work making
alterations, and asked the
master workman for a job.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>“I can give you no work
here,” was the rough reply.</p>

<p>The unkindness of the answer
touched his feelings, and
a tear slid down his cheek.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” asked
a gentleman, in kind tones.</p>

<p>He was the person who was
about to go into business in
the store.</p>

<p>“I want work, sir, for I am
very poor,” replied John Lowe.</p>

<p>“Haven’t I seen you before,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
somewhere?” asked the gentleman.
“I am sure I have.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir. My
name is John Lowe; I am a
carpenter by trade.”</p>

<p>“John Lowe!” exclaimed
the gentleman, grasping his
hand. “Don’t you know me?”</p>

<p>“I do not, indeed, sir.”</p>

<p>“My name is Henry Small.
You set me up in the newspaper
business sixteen years
ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>“I do remember; and I judge
by your looks that the world
has used you better than it
has me.”</p>

<p>“It has used me very well—perhaps
better than I deserve.”</p>

<p>John Lowe then told his
story, with many tears.</p>

<p>“Do not weep,” said Henry
Small. “I have done well
since we parted sixteen years
ago. The half dollar you lent
me has been the foundation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
my fortune. I have some thousands
of dollars now; but had
I only a dollar I would divide
it with you.”</p>

<p>John Lowe had all he wanted
as long as he lived. He
worked on good wages in Mr.
Small’s store for a time; but
when he could no longer
work, he was well cared for
by his friend.</p>
